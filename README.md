# myFlickr30k

This repository contains Myanmar (Burmese) language translations of the Flickr30k dataset captions. The translations were generated using [nllb-api](https://github.com/winstxnhdw/nllb-api) and we conducted preliminary image-to-caption experiments with the translated data.

The original Flickr30k dataset consists of 31,783 images collected from Flickr with 158,915 English captions (5 per image) created through crowdsourcing, as described in the paper ["From image descriptions to visual denotations: New similarity metrics for semantic inference over event descriptions"](https://aclanthology.org/P14-2106/).

**Current status**: 
- Under active development
- Manually verifying and correcting the automatic translation outputs
